# Introduction

This repository comprises of my haskell and lisp development
environment for EMACS.

# Installation

Whenever I need to setup a new machine, I download the setup-emacs.sh
shell script and invoke it to quickly install all the dependencies:

  `wget -qO - https://github.com/aycanirican/.emacs.d/raw/master/setup-emacs.sh | sh`
